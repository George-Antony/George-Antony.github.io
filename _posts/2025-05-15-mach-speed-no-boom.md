# Mach Speed, No Boom: The Silent Revolution in Supersonic Flight

## Introduction

For over a century, aviation has been defined by one relentless pursuit: speed. From the Wright brothers’ fragile biplane to today’s ultra-efficient jets, humans have been obsessed with flying faster and farther.

Supersonic flight can make long-distance travel much faster, but it comes with a major problem: the sonic boom. These loud shockwaves happen continuously while flying faster than sound and led to a U.S. ban on overland supersonic flights in the 1970s. As a result, Concorde - once the most famous supersonic airliner - was limited to a few international routes and never reached widespread use.

Today, new technologies are being developed to reduce or even eliminate sonic booms. This blog looks at the science behind the problem and the engineering solutions that could make quiet supersonic travel possible.

## What Does Supersonic Mean?

Supersonic refers to anything traveling faster than the speed of sound - Mach 1 or about 1,225 km/h (760 mph) at sea level and 15°C. For reference:

* **Subsonic:** Slower than Mach 1 (commercial airliners fall here).

* **Supersonic:** Just over Mach 1 (e.g., Concorde).

* **Hypersonic:** Speeds above Mach 5 (used in cutting-edge aerospace research).

Breaking the sound barrier once felt like breaching the edge of physics. Aircraft approaching Mach 1 would experience violent turbulence and shockwaves, earning the barrier a near-mythical status - until October 14, 1947, when Chuck Yeager flew the Bell X-1 at Mach 1.06 and shattered that belief forever.

## What Affects the Speed of Sound?

Interestingly, the speed of sound is not fixed - it varies depending on a few atmospheric factors:

* **Medium:** Sound travels fastest through solids, slower through liquids and slowest through gases like air.

* **Temperature:** Warmer air accelerates molecular movement, helping sound travel faster.

* **Humidity:** Moist air contains lighter water molecules, which can actually increase sound speed.

* **Altitude:** Higher altitudes have colder, thinner air - slowing sound down, which matters for aircraft cruising above 30,000 feet.

## The Sonic Boom

Supersonic flight comes with a negative side effect: the sonic boom - a sudden, thunderous shockwave generated as an object travels faster than the speed of sound. This is not a one-time event when the sound barrier is first broken; rather, it occurs continuously as long as the object remains at supersonic speeds. The resulting noise is not just loud - it is abrupt, jarring and can even cause structural damage.

To understand why this happens, we need to start with the Doppler Effect - that familiar shift in pitch as a siren speeds past. At subsonic speeds, sound waves move ahead of the aircraft, creating a smooth transition in pitch. But once an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, it begins to outrun those very sound waves.

This leads to a significant aerodynamic effect: sound waves compress into a cone-shaped shockwave trailing the aircraft, known as a Mach cone. When this cone reaches the ground, all the accumulated sound energy strikes at once - producing that unmistakable “boom”. The faster the aircraft flies, the tighter and more focused the cone becomes.

And here is the kicker: the sonic boom is not a one-off. As long as the aircraft stays supersonic, it continuously generates this shockwave, meaning the boom trails the plane along its entire flight path.

People on the ground only hear the boom after the aircraft has passed overhead - at the exact moment the Mach cone sweeps across their location. And the pilot and passengers? They never hear it. The boom forms and travels behind the aircraft, far out of earshot.

The legendary Concorde, which cruised at Mach 2, offered a glimpse into the future of supersonic commercial flight. But the boom was its Achilles’ heel.

Governments restricted Concorde to supersonic speeds only over oceans, dramatically limiting its routes. Pair that with its high operating costs and environmental concerns and it was ultimately grounded in 2003 - an engineering marvel that came too soon.

## The Silent Supersonic Revolution

Achieving boomless supersonic flight has long been a key objective for aerospace engineers. Central to this effort is the strategic shaping of aircraft to minimise shock wave intensity. One breakthrough approach involves altering the design to reduce the strength of the shock waves generated during flight. NASA’s X-59 aircraft exemplifies this innovation - it is engineered to create a softer “sonic thump” rather than a traditional boom, paving the way for public and regulatory acceptance of supersonic travel over land.

A critical concept in this domain is Mach cutoff, a flight regime typically occurring between Mach 1.0 and 1.3 at high altitudes. Under specific atmospheric conditions - such as temperature gradients and wind patterns - shock waves refract upward into warmer air layers, preventing them from reaching the ground. This phenomenon allows aircraft to fly faster than sound without causing disruptive noise at surface level.

The effectiveness of Mach cutoff hinges on real-time atmospheric conditions. Variations in temperature and wind can influence the local speed of sound, altering how shock waves behave. For instance, flying into a headwind can reduce the necessary speed for boomless flight, while a tailwind may require a higher Mach number. This sensitivity highlights the importance of precise atmospheric monitoring and adaptive flight control systems to ensure consistent, quiet performance.

## Innovations by Boom Supersonic

Boom Supersonic is developing technology for quiet supersonic travel. Their [Boomless Cruise](https://boomsupersonic.com/boomless-cruise) technology is designed around the principles of Mach cutoff, enabling supersonic flight over land without the disruptive sonic boom. By dynamically adjusting altitude and speed in response to real-time atmospheric data, their aircraft can ensure that shock waves dissipate away from populated areas.

In January 2025, Boom’s prototype aircraft, the XB-1, successfully demonstrated this capability. During test flights, the XB-1 broke the sound barrier multiple times without producing ground-level booms - an extraordinary achievement in the pursuit of quiet, high-speed travel.

## Conclusion

Boom Supersonic’s Overture aircraft represents the future of fast, sustainable air travel, with commercial service expected to begin by the early 2030s. Designed to cruise at Mach 1.7 over water - twice the speed of today’s airliners - and up to 50% faster over land using advanced noise-reduction technology, Overture aims to dramatically cut travel times on the world’s busiest routes. For instance, a transatlantic flight from New York to London could drop from 7 hours to just 3.5, while popular overland trips like Los Angeles to New York may shrink from about 6 hours to just 4. As this technology matures, the dream of boomless, efficient supersonic travel is becoming a tangible reality, reshaping not just how we fly - but how we experience the world.
