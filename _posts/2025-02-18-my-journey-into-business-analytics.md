Hi there!! I’m George, a Master's graduate in Business Analytics from the University of Exeter. As I embark on my journey into the world of data, I want to share my experiences, insights and projects with you on this blog.

From the start of my studies, I was captivated by how data can unlock powerful insights and help solve complex business problems. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve learned to use data cleaning, data analysis and data visualisation to bring meaning to raw data. My projects have ranged from analysing global pollution trends to examining consumer behaviour in retail and I’ve seen firsthand how data can drive better decisions.

What I find most exciting about Business Analytics is how its applications are endless – from shaping marketing strategies to predicting future trends. I’m eager to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field.

On this blog, I’ll be sharing not only the projects I’ve worked on but also tutorials, insights and thoughts on the latest trends in data science, business intelligence and analytics. Whether you're looking to learn more about data visualisation tools like Power BI, explore case studies or dive deep into the world of data, I hope this blog will provide value to you.

I invite you to follow along as I continue my job search in Business Analytics. I’m excited to connect with others who share my passion for data and its power to drive change.

Feel free to reach out for collaborations, projects, or simply to chat about the exciting world of data analytics!
