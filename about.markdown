Hello! I’m George, a Master’s graduate in Business Analytics from the University of Exeter. As I begin my journey into data, I want to share my experiences, insights and projects with you through this blog.

I’ve been fascinated by how data can solve complex business problems. I’ve learned to use data cleaning, analysis and visualisation to turn raw data into valuable insights. My projects have ranged from analysing global pollution trends to exploring consumer behaviour in retail, demonstrating how data drives better decisions.

This blog will feature my projects, tutorials and insights into data science, business intelligence and analytics. I hope you’ll find valuable content here.
