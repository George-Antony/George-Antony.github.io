Hello! I’m [Your Name], a Master’s graduate in Business Analytics from the University of Exeter. I’m passionate about using data to solve business problems and drive informed decision-making.

I have experience in data preparation, data analysis, and data visualisation, with expertise in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Advanced Excel. My projects have focused on global pollution trends and retail analytics, where I’ve analysed environmental data and consumer behaviour to provide actionable insights.

This blog serves as my portfolio and a space to share my work and thoughts on data analytics. As I continue my job search, I’m eager to apply my skills to help organisations make data-driven decisions and succeed in the digital age.

Feel free to get in touch for collaborations or to discuss data!
