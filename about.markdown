Hello! I’m George, a Master’s graduate in Business Analytics from the University of Exeter. As I begin my journey into data, I want to share my experiences, insights and projects with you through this blog.

From the start of my studies, I’ve been fascinated by how data can solve complex business problems. I’ve learned to use data cleaning, analysis and visualisation to turn raw data into valuable insights. My projects have ranged from analysing global pollution trends to exploring consumer behaviour in retail, demonstrating how data drives better decisions.

What excites me most about Business Analytics is its endless applications—from shaping marketing strategies to predicting trends. I’m eager to keep learning and growing in this field.

This blog will feature my projects, tutorials and insights into data science, business intelligence and analytics. Whether you're interested in tools like Tableau or exploring case studies, I hope you’ll find valuable content here.

I invite you to follow along as I continue my job search in Business Analytics. I’m excited to connect with others passionate about data and its power to drive change.

Feel free to reach out for collaborations, projects or just to chat about data analytics!
